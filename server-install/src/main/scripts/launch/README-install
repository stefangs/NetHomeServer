The NetHomeServer can be installed as a daemon on a linux system.

To install, you need to be root.
Change into the directory where the NetHomeServer distribution is located.

The following example works on a RaspberryPie.

REQUIREMENTS
- Java JRE 7/8 installed on the Rasberry Pie.

  Refer to: https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/OpenJFX/OpenJFX+on+the+Raspberry+Pi
  wget http://www.java.net/download/jdk8/archive/b109/binaries/jdk-8-ea-b109-linux-arm-vfp-hflt-25_sep_2013.tar.gz --no-check-certificate

  Unpack:
  sudo tar zxvf jdk-8-ea-b109-linux-arm-vfp-hflt-25_sep_2013.tar.gz -C /opt

  Create paths to the java and javac commands (so that they can be used) anywhere.
  When you have done this try the java --version command - if everything is done correctly
  this will return some information about the java installation
  Refer to: http://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-54112/l/java-on-the-raspberry-pi

  sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/opt/jdk1.8.0/bin/java" 1
  sudo update-alternatives --set java /opt/jdk1.8.0/bin/java

  Check:
  /opt/jdk1.8.0/bin/java -version

- Downloaded the nethomeserver binaries.

- If you are going to use a TellStick:

QUICK INSTALL
Run the following command:

  chmod +x install_daemon.sh
  sudo ./install_daemon.sh

This will make sure to setup a daemon that can be used to start/stop and show status of the
server. It will also make sure the script is executed at startup of the Raspberry Pie.

INSTALL EXPLAINED
The installation script starts with copying needed driver files and then continues replacing
certain keywords while constructing the daemon script and utility command from the templates
(nhs_daemon_template and nhs_template).

For the moment these keyword values are hardcoded, but may be configurable in future updates.
See files nhs_daemon_template, nhs_template and install_daemon.sh for details.

The daemon script is placed in the /etc/init.d/ directory and is given execute rights.
The utility command is placed in the /usr/sbin/ directory and is given execute rights.
Further, the script will make sure to change directory to the 'lib' dir where the nethome
server jar files are located, and the home.jar file is then run as the "pi" user by the java
runtime.

STARTING THE SERVICE MANUALLY
The service may be started, stopped, or queried in any of the following ways:

sudo nhs start|stop|status|restart|force-reload

TODO: Make sudo unnecessary to use 'nhs'

which will call the underlying daemon script as: service nhs-daemon restart|start|stop|status

UNINSTALL DAEMON

TODO: Uninstall option in install_daemon.sh script

sudo update-rc.d -f nhs-daemon remove
