 * LmSensorsFan. This module is a part of the NetHomeServer. 
 * The LmSensorsFan is a fan RPM display which presents data from the built in 
 * sensors of a PC. This item works on Linux and uses the �sensors�-command 
 * to get the data from the system. The sensors-program and information on how to 
 * configure that can be obtained from http://www.lm-sensors.org. The implementation
 * is basically identical to LmSensorsThermometer, so it just inherits that.
